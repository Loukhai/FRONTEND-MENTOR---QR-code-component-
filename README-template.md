## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- custom CSS properties
- Flexbox
- B.E.M Naming methodology

### What I learned

#### 1- In HTML

I made sure the QR card with a semantic HTML with practicing the BEM methodology in the classes nomination.

```html
<article>
  <!-- code ...-->
  <h2 class="card__description--title">
    Improve your front-end skills by building projects
  </h2>
  <p class="card__description--text">
    Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the
    next level
  </p>
  <!-- ...code -->
</article>
```

#### 2- In CSS

I make a custom class to don't repeat my self in styling (like a DRY principe but in css)

```css
.flex_center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 25px;
}
```

#### 3-In Skills

This is my first time that i write a documentation, i guess that is good practice to improve the thinking of the developer it self and the others of their codes and their the English language for anglophone people.

### Continued development

I will be practice more projects to improve my skills in like a front-end web developer

- [B.E.M Naming Methodology](https://getbem.com/naming/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand BEM Naming. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
